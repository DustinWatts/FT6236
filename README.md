# FocalTech Touch IC library for Arduino IDE

Arduino IDE library for initially written purely for the the FocalTech FT6236 touch controller. But more IC's are supported. At the moment the following IC's are supported:

- FT5436 (ChipID 0x54)
- FT6206 (ChipID 0x06)
- FT6236 (ChipID 0x36)
- FT6236U (ChipID 0x64)

# Datasheet

The datasheet can be found all over the internet, but this is one with the register descriptions in it. Which comes in handy!
